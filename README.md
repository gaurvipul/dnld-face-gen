# dnld-face-gen

1-Added xavier-initializer

2-Added dropout for every conv2d layer except last and dense

3-dropout rate for discriminator = 0.8

4-dropout rate for generator = 0.2

5-Generator trained twice as much as Discriminator

Result

6-Clearer Numbers and Faces 

7-Generator loss is lesser than Discriminator but might require a few more hyperparam changes
